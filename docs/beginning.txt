How to Proceed
Setup and Testing: Start by setting up your Raspberry Pi, ensuring you have Python installed, and setting up a virtual environment for your project. Install the basic dependencies (like RPi.GPIO, opencv-python for camera operations, pyaudio for audio, and any API client libraries you need).

Development: Begin by developing and testing each module (motors, camera, audio, chatgpt) individually. This modular approach helps isolate issues and makes debugging easier.

Integration: Once individual components are working, start integrating them. Your main.py will serve as the orchestrator, calling upon different modules based on inputs and conditions (e.g., when motion is detected, control motors; when audio is received, process and respond).

Testing and Refinement: Test the integrated system thoroughly. Expect to encounter and fix bugs during this phase. Refine your code based on test results and possibly user feedback.

Documentation and Maintenance: Document your setup and code. Good documentation will help you and others understand and maintain the project in the future.
